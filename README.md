## Daily Progress
### Day 1: HTML Basics
- Learned the structure of an HTML document:
  - <html>: Root element.
  - <head>: Contains metadata and links to resources.
  - <body>: Contains the visible content.
- Practiced using common tags:
  - Headings (<h1> to <h6>)
  - paragraphs( <p> )
  - lists( <ul>,<ol>,<li>)

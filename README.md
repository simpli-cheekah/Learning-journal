What I Learned

1. What is Front-End Development?

Focuses on creating the visible and interactive parts of a website or application.

Involves combining design and functionality for user experience.

2. What is a Webpage?

A document displayed in a browser.

Built using:

HTML: Structure (e.g., headings, text, links).

CSS: Styling (e.g., layout, colors, fonts).

JavaScript: Interactivity (e.g., forms, buttons).

3. How Browsers Work:

Browsers (e.g., Chrome, Safari) interpret HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to render webpages.

4. Role of Front-End Developers:

Build and style user interfaces.

Ensure responsiveness on different devices.

Test for compatibility across browsers.

5. Career Opportunities:

Roles include Front-End Developer, Web Designer, and UI/UX Designer.

6. Tools Used:

Code editors like Visual Studio Code.
Git and GitHub for version control.
Browsers for testing and debugging.

7. Importance of Responsive design
Adapts webpages for various screen sizes, ensuring usability on all devices.

## Future Goals
As someone aspiring to become a Full stack Developer and also delve into cloud computing, this respository marks 
the beginning of my journey.My long-term goals include mastering both front-end and back-end technologies, as well
as gaining expertise in deploying amd managing applications in the cloud.

Here are my specific goals moving forward:
1.FRONT-END DEVELOPMENT
-Deepen my knowledge of HTML, CSS and Javascript
-*learn modern front-end frameworks like React and vue.js*
-*learn responsive designing*
-learm DOM manipulation
-learn about version controls
-Build responsive,user friendly websites and applications
2. BACK-END DEVELOPMENT
-learn server-side programming using Node.js or python(Django/Flask)
-learn Frameworks for building ApIs with Node.js(Express.js)
-learn SQL: Relational databases like MySQL/PostgreSQL
-learn NoSQL:Non-relational databases like MongoDB
-learn JWT(JSON Web Tokens):For user authentication
-learn Deployement:Host your Web app on services like Heroku or Netlify
-Build projects
3.CLOUD COMPUTING
-learn and gain certifications in cloud platforms such as AWS,Google cloud, or Microsoft Azure
-learn DevOps Tools like Docker and Kubernetes
-learn CI/CD like Jenkins/GitHub Actions 
-learn Cloud security like IAM(identity and access management)
4.PROJECT DEVELOPMENT
-Work on personal projects to showcase my skills as a full stack developer and also in cloud computing
-Collaborate on open-source projects to learn teamwork and contribute to the developer community.

This learning journal is my first step toward achieving these goals,starting with mastering the fundamentals of
front-end development:)

## Learning Materials
I am following the *Meta Front-End Developer* course on [Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/). The course provides a structured path for learning front-end development, including HTML, CSS, and Javascript and more advanced topics. My progress and projects are based on the lessons and exercises from this course.
